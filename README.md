# Features
Currently, all the features of this monstrosity language —it is, in fact,  a language...technically— are quite limited:

| Feature       | Description                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Variables     | There are variables and they are not shared with the main Javascript code. They are actually stored in a JS Dict. In some cases it can be useful, in others not. But I don't think anyone will actually use this, so wtv. |
| Conditionals  | There's all the common conditional stuff: IF, IF-ELSE, and ELSE cases. And they work pretty much every time. Remember they MUST nest together (as pictured) to work properly. | 
| Functions     | The functions exist, but they are small, rustic and limited. For example, there is no argument passing or local variable buffering. I did it this way because it was easier... The code basically works by storing the function block in a table, and when the respective function is called, the code executes that stored block. This means that recursion is technically possible. |
| Loops         | No loops. Yet. |

Anyway, if you still think this might be helpful in any way, I warn you: it's probably a BAD IDEA, it's a CURSED thing to do, you WILL REGRET IT.
