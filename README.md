 Oh God what have I done.

# Features
Currently, all the features of the language —it is, in fact,  a language...technically— are quite limited.

| Feature       | Description                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Variables     | There is variables, and they're not shared with the main Javascript code. They are actually stored in a JS Dict. In some cases it may be useful, it others don't. But I don't think anyone will actually use this so wtv. |
| Conditionals  | There's all the common conditional stuff: IF, IF-ELSE and ELSE cases. And they work pretty much always. Just keep in mind that they NEED to nest (like in the image) to work properly. | 
| Functions     | Functions do exists, but they are small, rustic and limited. For example, there isn't any argument passing or local variable buffer. I did this way cuz was more easy... The code work basically storing the function block in a table, and the when the respective function is called, the code execute that stored block. It means that recursion technically is possible. |
| Loops         | No loops. Yet. |
